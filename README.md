# [mM]-Task
## Summary
Write a program in Java which takes an input text file and converts all the m's to M's and all the M's to m's. BTW, this is all it should do. It should not modify the input file in any other way. You should use the text file located at:

Run the program, select the file. Then, a file named "processed_FILENAME" will be greated with the hopefully desired output.
